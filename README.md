instagram-ios-sdk
=================

Framework to facilitate the use of instagram API. 

I started this project with requirements below:

1) Cover all code by tests in 100%
2) Use Typhoon framework for inject dependenses
3) Use Kiwi framework for writing tests
4) Stub the app-server interaction with Nocilla
5) Use BDD approach
6) Use AppCode

Development plan:

1) Create project for building framework.
2) Add ability to run all available API requests
3) Create demo project with some UI logic wich should be covered by Kiwi tests as well.
4) Improve framework API according to demo project needs.
